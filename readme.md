# homework 1

This is a multi-assignment homework: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3
- see [questions & instructions](instructions.md)
- see [expectations](https://github.com/UWMadison-computingtools-master/general-info/blob/master/rubric.md)
  with excellent = 3, satisfactory = 2, needs work =1, not done = 0 points.  
  For this homework, we will not use all rubric categories: we will skip
  "presentation: graphs and tables" and "achievement". We will grade the
  categories "code performance", "coding strategy", "coding style,
  "project documentation" and "work submission".

## homework 1.1 solution

Please delete this whole section.
Replace the current text by your own text describing your solution.
You should explain:

- what scripts were run, when, from which directory,
  under which platform (Mac, Linux etc)
- what the output file(s) are and where they are.
- typically, you would also explain the purpose of each script,
  what input files are used and where they are,
  but here this is already explained in [instructions.md](instructions.md)

Note that I am using markdown syntax in this file. For example,
this pound sign appears like a bit of code: `#`.
Placed at the beginning of a line, it creates a header (as used above).
`##` will create a smaller header than `#`, and `###` an even smaller header.
You can use these pound signs in your explanations to define subsections
and separate the explanations for the 3 different exercises.
You can use backticks to explain which commands should be used to run your code.
`this things appears like a command`.

```
this thing also appears like a command, but has its own larger box
```

We will learn more about markdown syntax later.

**Always check how things look like, after your push your work to github**.
You will be graded based on the work we will see and clone from github,
so always check what's on github before submitting your assignment.
Check that:
- the files that should be on github are indeed there,
- the readme file and other documentation files are rendered like they should
  be: headers do appear as headers, things in bold are in bold,
  code does appear as code, etc.

So go ahead and erase this whole section, then replace by your explanations.  
This is code / project documentation: get practice doing it.
